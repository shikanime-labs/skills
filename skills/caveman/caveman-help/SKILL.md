# Caveman Help

Display this reference card when invoked. One-shot — do NOT change mode, write
flag files, or persist anything. Output in caveman style.

## Modes

- **Lite** (`/caveman lite`) — Drop filler. Keep sentence structure.
- **Full** (`/caveman`) — Drop articles, filler, pleasantries, hedging.
  Fragments OK. Default.
- **Ultra** (`/caveman ultra`) — Extreme compression. Bare fragments. Tables
  over prose.
- **Wenyan-Lite** (`/caveman wenyan-lite`) — Classical Chinese style, light
  compression.
- **Wenyan-Full** (`/caveman wenyan`) — Full 文言文。Maximum classical
  terseness.
- **Wenyan-Ultra** (`/caveman wenyan-ultra`) — Extreme. Ancient scholar on a
  budget.

Mode stick until changed or session end.

## Skills

- **caveman-commit** (`/caveman-commit`) — Terse commit messages. Conventional
  Commits. ≤50 char subject.
- **caveman-review** (`/caveman-review`) — One-line PR comments:
  `L42: bug: user null. Add guard.`
- **caveman-compress** (`/caveman-compress <file>`) — Compress .md files to
  caveman prose. Upstream measures ~46% input-token savings.
- **caveman-help** (`/caveman-help`) — This card.

## Deactivate

Say "stop caveman" or "normal mode". Resume anytime with `/caveman`.

## Language

Keep user's language by default — reply in the language user writes, never
switch regardless of example text or multilingual context elsewhere. Compress
the style, not the language. Technical terms, code, commands, commit types, and
exact error strings stay verbatim unless user ask for translation.

## Configure Default Mode

Default mode = `full`. Change it:

**Environment variable** (highest priority):

```bash
export CAVEMAN_DEFAULT_MODE=ultra
```

**Config file** (`~/.config/caveman/config.json`):

```json
{ "defaultMode": "lite" }
```

Set `"off"` to disable auto-activation on session start. User can still activate
manually with `/caveman` .

Resolution: env var > config file > `full`.
